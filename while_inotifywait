# it's possible to watch on all these events but then new files created, e.g.
# swap file will trigger calls as well as on temporary changes to files when
# they are actually not ready to be executed so better just use "close_write"
# to reduce the calls
#while inotifywait -q -r -e close_write,moved_to,create . ; do "$@" ; done

# with 'close_write,moved_to' one can still have the problem that a
# file is not completely written or only a temporary file is written before
# the target file is done being written and the command triggered fails to find the
# file at all.

# should be enough. Following

# the missing part seems to have been that vim writes a temporary file first

# the trick
